Bowling Score Calculator
Goal
Write a basic bowling game scoring calculator, which accepts individual rolls and provides the correct score for them.

How bowling scoring works
A bowling game is broken down into multiple attempts to knock down 10 pins with your ball. 
Each turn you get two attempts to knock down all 10 pins. Each turn is called a "frame" during scoring.

Open frames
If you do not knock down all 10 pins in a frame, it is considered open.

The score of the frame is simply the number of pins knocked down in total.

Spares
If you knock down all 10 pins using both rolls of a frame, you get a spare.

A spare earns 10 points, plus the number of pins knocked down in your next roll.

Strikes
If you knock down all 10 pins in a single roll, you get a strike.

Strikes earn 10 points, plus the sum of your next two rolls.

The 10th frame
Scoring the 10th frame works slightly differently

If you roll a strike on the first attempt, the pins are reset and you get two more rolls
If you roll a spare in the first two attempts, the pins are reset and you get 1 additional roll
If you roll an open frame, the your turn is over
There are no modifiers applied to the 10th frame, the score is the number of pins knocked down.
